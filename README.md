    └── (e.g., logo.png, hero-background-placeholder.jpg, service-icons, etc. - to be added by user)
```

## How to View

1.  **Download or Clone the Files:** Ensure all files and folders (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc., along with the `css`, `js`, and `images` directories) are in the same root directory on your local machine.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open any of the `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`) directly in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    - You can typically do this by double-clicking the HTML file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with..." your preferred browser.

## Key Features Implemented

- **Responsive Design:** The website layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- **Semantic HTML5:** Structured for clarity and SEO.
- **CSS Styling:** Modern look and feel with a professional color palette.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:**
  - Mobile navigation toggle (hamburger menu).
  - Dynamic copyright year update in the footer.
  - Basic client-side form validation example on the contact page.
- **SEO Considerations:**
  - Meta tags (description, keywords) for each page.
  - Proper heading structure.
  - Image alt tags (placeholders for actual images).
- **Content:** All relevant content from the provided URLs has been integrated into the new structure.

## Visual Enhancements & Next Steps (User Actions)

To make the website truly "stunning" and "visually appealing" as per the request, the following should be considered:

1.  **Add Actual Images:**

    - Replace text logo in `header` with an actual logo image (e.g., `images/logo.png`).
    - Replace placeholder hero background (`images/hero-background-placeholder.jpg`) on `index.html` with a high-quality, relevant image.
    - Add icons for services on `index.html` and `services.html` (e.g., `images/icon-residential.svg`).
    - Include images on the `about.html` page (e.g., team photo, work van).
    - Ensure all images are optimized for the web (size and format).

2.  **Implement Favicon:** Add a `favicon.ico` to the root directory and uncomment the link in the `<head>` of each HTML file.

3.  **Interactive Map:** On `contact.html`, replace the map placeholder with an embedded Google Map or similar.

4.  **Advanced CSS & JS:**

    - Consider using a custom web font.
    - Implement more sophisticated animations and transitions (e.g., on scroll).
    - Enhance form validation with more user-friendly inline messages.

5.  **Backend for Contact Form:** The contact form in `contact.html` currently has `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID"`. For it to actually send emails, you need to:

    - Create a free account at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/).
    - Set up a new form endpoint.
    - Replace `YOUR_UNIQUE_ID` in `contact.html` with the unique ID Formspree provides for your form.

6.  **Social Media Links:** Placeholder links in the footer have been updated with the provided URLs. Review and confirm they are correct.

7.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test across different browsers and devices.

## Important Clarification Required

- **Free Estimates:** Your original website and this new site state that Brant Electric offers "Free Estimates." However, information found on Angi.com suggests that free estimates are _not_ offered. Please verify the correct policy so the website content can be made accurate. The site currently reflects that free estimates are offered.

This structure provides a solid foundation for a professional and effective website for Brant Electric.
